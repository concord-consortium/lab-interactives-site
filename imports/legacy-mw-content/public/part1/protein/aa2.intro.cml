<text>The Case of Sickle Cell Anemia
 
Figure 1: A hemoglobin Molecule

Hemoglobin is one of the most important proteins in our body (Figure 1). It ferries oxygen from the lungs to where it is needed, and assists in the transportation of carbon dioxide back to the lungs, where it is exhaled. It is perfectly shaped for this job. Red blood cells have evolved as specialized cells, empty of the usual cell structures, including the nucleus; instead there are many hemoglobin molecules placed in each cell. Because hemoglobin is so critical, variations in its oxygen-carrying shape can be fatal. 
   
Sickle Cell Anemia is a hemoglobin-related disease that is now understood at the level of genetic code and the protein for which the DNA codes. In this short essay you will explore what happens when you have it, and begin to learn about what causes it.

 

In 1956, scientist Vernon Ingram, the pioneer hemoglobin researcher, mapped out the amino acid sequence of sickle cell hemoglobin, and showed that there was only one amino acid difference between normal and diseased hemoglobin -- the glutamic acid amino acid at position 6 on the globin chain had been replaced by a valine amino acid. What difference could such a small change make in a molecule as large as hemoglobin, made of hundreds of amino acids? In this activity, you are going to relate the symptoms of Sickle Cell Anemia to the interactions of molecules in a peptide chain, how that affects the folding of the chain, and why this could be responsible for the disease.

    &lt;b&gt;A Patient&apos;s View&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Sickle Cell Anemia... &amp;quot;The child becomes 
    pale, tires easily, eats poorly and may complain of pain in the arms, 
    legs, back and abdomen...When these symptoms become severe, this is known 
    as a sickle-cell crisis. For variable periods...even chronically anemic 
    patients may go along without any complaints. Then with an attack of 
    tonsilitis or common cold or sometimes for no apparent reason, they become 
    acutely ill for a week or two. The first sign of crisis is usually loss of 
    appetite followed by paleness and weakness. Pain in the abdomen, legs and 
    arms may be severe and there may be some swelling in the joints.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;- 
    M.I. Johnson, The World and the sickle-cell gene: a study in health 
    education, New York: Trado-Medic Books, 1985, p. 54. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the 
    children grow up, their hands and feet may swell, their spleen can get 
    blocked by blood cells and therefore swell, bones can be destroyed, and, 
    beyond these and many other symptoms, there is the risk of sudden death.
